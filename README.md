- Trade Secrets:
- ![[Pasted image 20251112165056.png]]
	- Could be what you pay employees, customer lists, recepies (non technical things can qualify as trade secrets)
- ![[Pasted image 20251112165325.png]]
- Know how is different than trade secrets
- ![[Pasted image 20251112165443.png]]
- Improper means would be like hacking into someones system and stealing their customer list
- Breach of confidence is like when an employee steals confidential info 
- If it is possible to reverse engineer something, then its permissable for use of the trade secret. that is not stealing the trade secret

### Trademark
Protection Based on Strength of Mark (4 Categories) - NEED TO GIVE EXAMPLES, may be asked to analyze a trademark and trademark infringement:
- Fanciful (e.g. Lexus) or arbitrary (e.g. Apple Computer)
	- inherently distinctive - protectable
- Suggestive (e.g, Speedo Swimsuits)
	- Inherently distinctive - protectable
- Descriptive (e.g. Mike's Bar and Grill)
	- Protectable only with acquired distinctiveness (also known as secondary meaning)
- Generic (e.g. Milk for beverage from cows)
	- Never protectable
	
Fair Use in Trademark Law (need to research this more):
- If the mark is descriptive, you are allowed to use the name in a way that describes your goods and services
- Think of the Fish-Fri and Chick-Fri case (Zatarain's Inc v. Oak Grove Smokehouse)
	- District court held that Oak Grove had "fair use" defense to assert infringement of "Fish-Fri", but trademark registration for "Chick-Fri" should be cancelled.
	- Generic terms can never be registered and if terms become generic they can loose their protection (asprin, Cellophane)
	- The issue here was that Chick-Fri was generic, but Fish-Fri was not.

Risk of Genericness in Trademarks:
- If a trademark becomes generic, it is dead (asprin, elevator, escalator)
- There was a court case arguing that Google had become generic, but the court decided it was not. This is a risk for companies.

Establishment of Trademark Rights - Distinctivness of Product Configuration
- Product configuration protectable only when there is acquired distinctiveness (Qualitex Co. v Jacabson)
	- Qualitex Co. v. Jacobson will be on exam by name.
		- Qualitex used a special shade of green-gold color on pads sold to dry cleaning firms since 1950's
		- in 1989, Jacobson started selling its own press pads using similar colot
		- In 1991, Qualitex registered color with USPTO
		- Qualitex won in district court but lost in 9th circuit. Supreme court reversed 9th circuit so Qualitex won in the end.
	- Shape of coke bottle, NBC 3 chime, scent have all been registered

Walmart v. Samara Brothers (need to research this) (also about distinctiveness of product configuration)
- Suit by Samara Brothers against walmart for infringement of unregisstered trade dress under section 1125(a) for "knockoff" clothing
- Distinctiveness in two ways:
	- Inherently: "intrinsic nature serves to identify a particular source"
	- Developed Secondary Meaning: "occurs when, in the minds of the public, the primary significance of a mark is to identify the source of the product rather than the product itself"
- "A products design is distinctive and therefore protectable only upon a showing of secondary meaning"

Functionality is Prohibited in Trademark
- Traffix Devices inc V Marketing Displays
	- MDI asserts TDI infringed it trade dress in dual-spring design for road signs
	- MDI had an expired patent for the technology, and then tried to use trademark to defend its product
	- However, trademark can not be applied to functional item. No trade dress for MDI. The fact that MDI had a patent shows on its own that the spring design was functional.

Priority in Trademark
- Being first to use a distinctive mark in commerce is key. You dont need to be first with a trademark application on file, you have to be first to use the mark in commerce.
	- Determination of ownership under common law under Lanham Act base on priority

Intent to use applications
- You can under certain circumstances file for and have allowed an application for a mark you haven't started using yet.
	- This allows people who have a "bona-fide" or good faith intention to use the trademark to reserve it for use in the near future. Then once you prove to the trademark office you are using it, it then can turn into an isssued trademark.

Advantages of Federal Registration (WILL BE ON EXAM):
- Nationwide constructive use and constructive notice
- After 5 years, incontestability possible
- Right to file suit in federal court
- Right to request that customs officials bar importation of goods bearing infringing marks
- Treble damages, attorney fees, and other remedies.

Geographic marks
- You cannot get a registered trademark if it is primarily geographically descriptive OR primarily geographically mis-descriptive.
	- However, if you have acquired distinctiveness, then you can.

Trademark infringement Threshold - Use
- For trademark protection, and owner must use a mark in commerce

Trademark infringement - Likelihood of confusion
- AMF v. Sleekcraft (THE EIGHT FACTORS, will likely have to apply these factors on exam) no supreme court decision on htis, but the sleekcraft case is an example.
	- the strength of the mark
	- proximity of goods
	- similarity of marks
	- evidence of actual confusion
	- marketing channels used
	- Type of goods and degree of care likely to be exercised by purchaser
	- defendants intent on electing mark
	- likelihood of expansion of product lines

THE REVIEW SLIDES HAVE THINGS THAT WILL LIKELY BE ON EXAM

Trademark dilution (need to understand tthis)
- The mark has to be famous.
- Dilution by Blurring (need to know)
- Dilution by Tarnishment (need to know)

Anticybersquatter consumer protection act
- A bad faith intent to profit from a mark - by registering trafficing in or using a domain name that is identical or confusingly similar to distinctive mark or identical or confusingly similar to or dilutive of famous mark
	- Theses are in rem actions (court has authority over the domain name itself)

Defenses to Trademark Infringement:
- Genericness - Elliot v. Google case
- Functionality - TrafFix Devices case
- Abandonment
- Fair Use
- Non-Trademark Use

Trademark Abandonment - mark looses its significance 
America invents Act:
- Changes in US patent law to definition of prior art
- US patent law went from first to invent, to first to file system, which put the us more in line for the rest of the world
- Some patents still exist from before america events, so it still matters to understand how the law used to be.

5 basic requirements for Patentability: (likely to ask about all of these)
- Patentable Subject matter (what constitutes it?)
- Utility
- Novelty
- Non-obviousness (look to "ordinary skill in the art")
- Disclosure (enablement, written description)

Novelty before and after America Invents Act
- Novelty USED to be determined based on the date of the invention
- Under the new law, novelty is based on the filing date. Applies to patents and patent applications on or after March 16, 2013

Graham v. John Deere
- Know the factors for this case
- Scope and content of the prior art
- differences between the prior art and the claims at issue
- The level of ordinary skill in the art
- Secondary considerations of non-obviousness (commercial success, long-term need, failure of others, unexpected results)
- The first three factors may go against you, but the secondary considerations may give valid reasons to your case.

Likely to give us an example or scenario where we have to analyze obviousness

Utility Requirement:
- You have to assert some usefullness for the invention. It needs to have a practical use.

Disclosure Requirement:
- Why is there a disclosure requirement?
- When a patent is issued, the owner has a right to exclude others for term of patent
- But when patent term is over, the invention is in the public domain
- Therefore, in exchange for exclusive right, inventor must describe to the public how to make and use the invention
Disclosure Requirements:
- Written description (Is the inventor in possession at the time of the application?)
- Enablemnent (can one of ordinary skill make and use the invention? This must be adequately be explained)
- Best Mode (inventor not permitted to maintain trade secret on best way of performing invention, no longer a defense to patent infringement)
Amgen V. Sanofi Case:
- The antibodies case

Patentable Subject Matter:
- any new and useful process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement therof

Old Patent Law (Novelty):
- You can not get a patent if it is known or used in the US or published anywhere before invention
- Public use or sale in the US or published anywhere more than one year before application filed (experimental use exception)
- First to invent system
New Patent Law (Novelty):
- No if known, used or published anywhere before the filing date
- Grace period remains for disclosures by inventor or someone who recieved information directly or indirectly from inventor not more than one year before filing
- Derivation proceedings replace interferences

Old Patent Law (Nonobviousness):
- Not patentable if subject matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary skill in the art
New Patent Law (Nonobviousness):
- Not patentable if claimed invention as a whole would have been obvious before the effective filing date of the claimed invention to a person having ordinary skill in the art

Graham Vs John Deere (know the factors in this case)

AI is not capable of inventorship

Claim Construction:
- Knowing what claim terms mean is a critical part of patent disputes

Indefiniteness - can you reasonable assertain the meaning of the claim? Need to know what indefiniteness is in claims

Infringement
- litoral infringement
- Infringement under the doctrine of equivalence

Indirect infringement
- Contributory Infringement
- Inducing Infringement

Infringement Defenses:
- Non-infringement
- Invalidity
- With Authority
- Unenforceability

Patent Exhaustion - Under principle of exhaustion, first unrestricted sale of patented product exhausts patentee's control
- Resale cannot be controlled by patentee
- Repair generally cannot be controlled by patentee

Other notes:
- 40-60% of test is short answer, remaining is essay question
- Essay question on trademark and patents
- Maybe essay on where is the internet and trade secrets.
- Issues of novelty and obviousness will have longer question
- Likelyhood of confusion factors
- Whether a mark is descriptive
